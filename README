Octave-Avifile
==============

Description
-----------
A wrapper for FFMpeg's libavformat and libavcodec, allowing Octave to read
and write fixed-framerate AVI (Audio/Video Interleaved) files.

Dependencies
------------
You'll need the FFMpeg libraries and header files. Note that FFMpeg is
released under the LGPL.  It can be downloaded from

http://ffmpeg.sf.net,

but your distribution may already have packages available.

Debian: libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev
Mandrake: libffmpeg0-devel libffmpeg0

Compiling
---------
$ ./configure
$ make

The commands `avifile' and `addframe' should then be available in Octave.

Usage Notes
-----------
- If FFMpeg complains about "too many threads", increase the frame height
  and width.  For some obscure reason, they do a comparison between the number
  of threads and the frame dimensions.
  
- Remember to `clear' a movie after adding the last frame.  This gives
  `avifile' a chance to write some headers and close the file, i.e.
  
  octave:1> x = avifile("test.avi", "msmpeg4v2");
  octave:2> addframe(x, zeros(100,100));
  octave:3> clear x

- If `aviinfo' crashes, you might have run into a libstdc++ memory allocation
  bug.  Work around the problem by executing
  
  $ export GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW=1
  
  before running Octave.
