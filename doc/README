Dependencies
------------
This package _should_ always work with the latest version of ffmpeg. It is
known to at least work with ffmpeg SVN revision 15410.

You can download ffmpeg from
http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu

Note that you'll need to configure it with --enable-swscale and --enable-gpl,
to enable the software scaler library (used for yuv/rgb conversions).

Usage Notes
-----------
- If ffmpeg complains about "too many threads", increase the frame height
  and width.  For some obscure reason, they do a comparison between the number
  of threads and the frame dimensions.
  
- Remember to `clear' a movie after adding the last frame.  This gives
  `avifile' a chance to write some headers and close the file, i.e.
  
  octave:1> x = avifile("test.avi", "msmpeg4v2");
  octave:2> addframe(x, zeros(100,100));
  octave:3> clear x

- If `aviinfo' crashes, you might have run into a libstdc++ memory allocation
  bug.  Work around the problem by executing
  
  $ export GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW=1
  
  before running Octave.
